        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol type = "1" >
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Hi! I'm Dani Sas, I am a Communication Design Major, and I am currently a Senior but will need an extra year to graduate so I'm kind of still a Junior</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Before declaring my major in Sam Fox, I was a mechanical engineering student in McKelvey. I loved being exposed to new forms of technology, but, as time went on, it just wasn't in very fun ways. So I transfered to Sam Fox and when I saw this was a requirement, I was very excited because it seemed like a great way to learn a new form of Tech and apply it in cool ways.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">I have no experience in HTML or CSS. I took a class on how to use Java my freshman year so I have a little coding experience, but very little with regards to this class's languages.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">I think one thing I'd love to learn in this class is how to make websites that can help tell stories. I think Projects like MS Paint Adventurers and Homestar Runner are such rad ways of using the medium and so I would like to learn how to make interactive storytelling in a Browser Based format.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">The biggest difference I see for me when designing for screen versus paper is the idea that I have to have a very different tool set to make my ideas reality. If on paper I visualize a design, I can just sketch it out. Now that we are designing through code, I have an idea in my head that I have to figure out how to display through inputing text into a document.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">A website that I feel exemplifies effective design is 
                <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoons</a> https://www.webtoons.com/en/. As it was created originally for mobile in mind, it pioneered a new form of comics that breaks the traditional design of virtually flipping every page, but allowing you to scroll down for a more natural and less broken up feel. It's home page is also very well designed as it shows you comics you may like, organizes them by what day of the week they update, but also gives you the freedom to explore their catalog in your own ways, by either searching or by genre.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">I believe that <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/>The New York Times'</a> website exemplifies effective communication https://www.nytimes.com/. When going on the sight, you are immediately given a large amount of articles to read further into, but it doesn't feel cramped or unreadable. Each articles headline is bolded, and then there is a little abstract of the article and sometimes a picture to get you interested. Each piece is given plenty room to breath so viewers can find the articles that they want to without getting intimidated or lost.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">For my website that I think works well, it has to be <a href=https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football>SB Nation's 17776</a> https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football. It is such a fun way of storytelling that for an entire month of releases, people were consistently checking back in each day to see a new upload. It uses its medium of being a scrollable website to it's advantage by portraying the story of 17776 through multiple mediums like video and chat logs which keeps things refreshing but also immersive.</li>
